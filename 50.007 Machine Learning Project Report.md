## Part 1: Labelling

Omitted.

## Part 2: Emission

The first order of business is to use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the emission parameters from the training set, as per the equation below:
$$
e(x|y) = \frac{Count(y\rightarrow x)}{Count(y)}
$$
Our implementation of this can be found in the private method `__est_emission_params()` in the class part2. Here, we use a dictionary `count_y`, `count_y_to_x`, and `e_x_given_y` to keep track of the total number of occurrences of y, total number of emissions from y to x, and the probability of an emission of an x for a given y. We first populate `count_y_to_x` by iterating through the dataset, then iterating through that to populate `count_y`. Finally, `e_x_given_y` is generated as follows:

```python
#If the word token x:
for entry, count in count_y_to_x.items(): #where entry is a tuple (x,y)
	self.e_x_given_y[entry] = count/count_y[entry[1]]
    
#If the word token x is the special token #UNK#:
for entry, count in count_y.items(): #where entry is y
	self.e_x_given_y[("#UNK#",entry)] = 0.5/(count+0.5)

```

There is also the need to produce the tag:
$$
y^* = \underset{y}{\textrm{arg max }}e(x|y)
$$
for each word x in the sequence. This is done in the method `find_y_max_given_x`, which simply iterates through `e_x_given_y`, getting the value x that is associated with the highest probability for a given y, and associating the respective x and y as a key-value pair in the dictionary `x_max_prob`. Specifically, the code does the following:

```python
for entry, prob in self.e_x_given_y.items(): #where entry is a tuple (x,y)
    if entry[0] not in x_max_prob:
        x_max_prob[entry[0]] = prob
        self.y_max_given_x[entry[0]] = entry[1]
     else:
        if x_max_prob[entry[0]]<prob:
            x_max_prob[entry[0]] = prob
            self.y_max_given_x[entry[0]] = entry[1]
```

## Part 3: Transmission and Viterbi

We first need to estimate the transition parameters from the training set according to the following equation:
$$
q(y_i|y_{i-1})=\frac{Count(y_{i-1},y_i)}{Count(y_{i-1})}
$$
Our implementation of this can be found in the private method `__est_transition_params()` in the class part3. Here, similar to part2, we use a dictionary `count_y`, `count_y0_to_y1`, and `p_y1_given_y0` to keep track of the total number of occurrences of state y, total number of transitions from y0 to y1 for state transitions in the training data, and the probability of an transition to state y1 given a previous state y0. We first populate `count_y0_to_y1` by iterating through lines in the dataset, accounting for the transitions involving the "START" and "STOP" states:

```python
for line in self.train_data:
    if previous_state == None: 
    previous_state = "START"
    state = line[1]
    transition = (previous_state, state)
    count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] = count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] + 1 if 		transition in count_y0_to_y1 else 1
    count_y["START"] = count_y["START"] + 1 if "START" in count_y else 1

    elif line[1] == "":
        state = "STOP"
        transition = (previous_state, state)
        count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] = count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] + 1 if transition in count_y0_to_y1 else 1
        previous_state = None

    else:
        state = line[1]
        transition = (previous_state, state)
        count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] = count_y0_to_y1[(transition)] + 1 if transition in count_y0_to_y1 else 1
        count_y[state] = count_y[state] + 1 if state in count_y else 1
        previous_state = state
```

We also simultaneously iterate through the lines of the training data to populate `count_y`. Finally, `p_y1_given_y0` is generated as follows:

```python
for entry, count in count_y0_to_y1.items():
    try:
        self.p_y1_given_y0[entry] = count/count_y[entry[0]]
    except:
        self.p_y1_given_y0[entry] = count/count_y[entry[0]]
```



We then need to use the Viterbi algorithm to compute the following:
$$
y_1^*,...,y_n^*=\underset{y_1,...,y_n}{\textrm{arg max }}p(x_1,...,x_n,y_1,...,y_n)
$$
In particular, we use the dynamic programming sequence:
$$
\pi(j+1,u) = \textrm{max}_v\{\pi(j,v)\times b_u(x_{j+1})\times a_{v,u}\} \\
\textrm{where: }\\
\begin{align}
\pi &= \textrm{a 2-D array}\\
u &= \textrm{current node}\\
v &= \textrm{previous node}\\
a &= \textrm{transition probability}\\
b &= \textrm{emission probarbility}
\end{align}
$$

The first step to running the Viterbi algorithm was to format the input test data such that it could be iterated through easily. Hence, we implemented this through `__format_testdata()` in class part3, which returned a nested list of words/sequences, with each nested list containing the words forming a sequence in the input data, as follows:

```python
def __format_testdata(self):
    """makes test data iterable for viterbi
    returns input test_data as a nested list of words/sentences, 
    each nested list is 1 sentence in the input data
    """
    test_sequences = [[]]
    test_data = self.test_data
    i = 0
    for line in test_data:
        if line == "": # indicates a new sequence
            test_sequences.append([])
            i += 1
        else:
            test_sequences[i].append(line.strip('\n'))
    test_sequences.pop() # remove space in last line
    self.input_sequences = test_sequences
```

Our data is now ready to be input to the Viterbi algorithm. In implementing the Viterbi algorithm, we considered how Viterbi would be run for each sequence/sentence in the input test data. Hence, we decided to modularise our implementation through the methods `__mini_viterbi(input_sequence, emission_dict, transition_dict)` and `viterbi()`. `__mini_viterbi(input_sequence, emission_dict, transition_dict)`  would be the method we call for each sequence to predict the most probable state sequence for the given observations based on our transition and emission parameters calculated previously on the training data. Our implementation involves storing and updating the most probable transition and emission sequence for the given observation in the nested dictionary `sequence_prob`, updating it based on the following conditions:

```python
for current_state in sequence_prob[layer]:
    max_p = 0
    max_prob_prev_state = "NA"
    for previous_state in sequence_prob[layer - 1]:
        transition = (previous_state, current_state)

        if (input_sequence[layer - 1], current_state) in emission_dict.keys() and transition in transition_dict.keys():
            p = sequence_prob[layer - 1][previous_state]["p"] * \
                transition_dict[(transition)] * \
                emission_dict[(input_sequence[layer - 1], current_state)]
        elif transition in transition_dict.keys():
            p = sequence_prob[layer - 1][previous_state]["p"] * \
                transition_dict[(transition)] * \
                0.00000000000001 # to allow initial state "NA" to be updated
        else:
            p = sequence_prob[layer - 1][previous_state]["p"] * \
                0.00000000000001 * \
                0.00000000000001 # to allow initial state "NA" to be updated
        if p > max_p:
            max_p = p
            max_prob_prev_state = previous_state
    sequence_prob[layer][current_state] = {"p": max_p, "previous": max_prob_prev_state}

```

We first initialise the most probable `previous_state` for each layer to be "NA", after which we would update the values according to the combined emission and transition probabilities. Afterwards, we then perform backtracking to find `argmax` to output the `predicted_sequence` of state transitions based on the observation, as follows:

````python
# backtracking to find argmax
current_layer = n
reverse_path = ["STOP"]
while current_layer >= 0:
    reverse_path.append(sequence_prob[current_layer + 1][reverse_path[len(reverse_path) - 1]]["previous"])
    # just means taking the current state being backtracked, find its most probable previous state as argmax
    current_layer -= 1

predicted_sequence = reverse_path[::-1][1:len(reverse_path)-1]

return predicted_sequence
````

We then define the method `viterbi()` to iteratively run the Viterbi algorithm for all input sequences in the training date (from `input_sequences` in `__format_testdata()`), and return a nested list of predicted state sequence for all sentences within the input test data `dev-in`.

   ```python
pred_state_sequences = [[]]
i = 0
for input_sequence in input_sequences:
    for state in self.__mini_viterbi(input_sequence, emission_dict, transition_dict):
        pred_state_sequences[i].append(state)
    pred_state_sequences.append([]) # to store state sequence for next sentence
    i += 1
pred_state_sequences.pop() # remove last []
return pred_state_sequences
   ```

## Part 4: Top 3 Sequences



## Part 5: Design Challenge

To modify and improve on the current sentiment analysis model, we decided to focus on refining the input parameters, specifically, the emission parameters. In our use of Maximum Likelihood Estimates for this project, we assigned the emission parameters of unknown observations to a fixed formula, given by:

(insert formula here)

Hence, we sought to attempt to improve this by implementing the smoothing technique, Absolute Discounting, on the emission parameters instead. This method involves substracting a small amount of probability, p, from all symbols assigned a non zero probability at states s. This probability p is then distributed equally over symbols given zero probability by the MLE. 

This would then affect the previously generated emission parameters in part 2 according to the following formula:

(insert formula here)

where v is number of symbols assigned non zero probability at a state s and N is the total number of symbols. This would allow us to
